# Mtcars-Flask-Api
Mtcars as the sample dataset to employ the Flask API. 
I used catboosting to fit the model and this directory includes the predict_hw.py which is the catboosting model, the server.py is the server connection python file. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml both set the environment in the docker, and the requirements is the python package that I need to have along with the dockerfile.
